	RESULTS
	{
		default = You observe the growth of the plant samples.
		
		KerbinSrfLandedWater = The salt water seeps into the hydroponics unit. The plants don't seem to like this
		KerbinSrfLandedGrasslands = The plants look identical to the ones outside. This isn't a surprise, considering the plant samples came from here
		KerbinSrfLandedHighlands = Despite the decrease in atmospheric pressure, most of the plants seem to be handling the change in altitude well.
		KerbinSrfLandedShores = Contrary to what you expected, the plants simply love the sand!
		KerbinSrfLandedMountains = The plants aren't growing so well anymore. That's probably why the mountaintops are so barren.			KerbinSrfLandedBadlands = Did the plants have shades before?
		KerbinSrfLandedDeserts = The plants seem to be shrivelling up here, despite being mostly immersed in water.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Some of the less well adapted plants are slowly dying to the cold.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = The plants closest to the heaters are doing quite well. You suspect the others would be wilting if they weren't frozen solid.
		KerbinSrfLandedNorthernIceShelf = Looking at how the plants are growing, you realise why no plants grow here.
		
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = The salt water seeps into the samples. They appear to be dying.
		KerbinSrfSplashedGrasslands = The plants seem to be doing better than ever.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = Large amounts of salt water and sand are flowing into the hydroponics system. You hope this doesn't damage the plumbing.
		KerbinSrfSplashedDesert = Although this seems like a lovely place for a swim, the plants aren't enjoying it quite as much.
		KerbinSrfSplashedBadlands = The plants are looking pretty cool right now ðŸ˜Ž
		KerbinSrfSplashedTundra = The plants are slowly freezing solid. Why did you think this was a good idea?
		KerbinSrfSplashedIceCaps = The water is cold enough to completely freeze the hydroponics. So why is there liquid water here?
		KerbinSrfSplashedNorthernIceShelf = The plants aren't growing well here. This is not a surprise, given the complete lack of native foliage.
		KerbinSrfSplashedSouthernIceShelf = As you observe the plants, you are interrupted by a telephone call telling you that the warranty is cancelled.
		
		KerbinFlyingLowWater = The sea spray appears to have no effect on the plants.
		KerbinFlyingLowShores = There is a slight amount of salt in the air building up on the plants.
		KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Despite the temperature here being higher than average, the plants seem cooler than ever.
		KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = As you pass through a small sandstorm, the sand turns the hydroponics into a swamp.
		KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = The air here is perfect for the plants, although the wind is probably stronger than they are used to.
		KerbinFlyingLowMountains = As you fly precariously close to a mountain peak, even the plants appear to have goosebumps.
		KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = The plants start speaking in strong Scottish accents. You neglect to tell mission control of this discovery.
		KerbinFlyingLowTundra = A breeze from the lab makes its way into your cockpit. You shiver slightly and hope you can close the sample doors soon.
		KerbinFlyingLowSouthernIceShelf = The icy cold of the surface is only getting colder as you go up.
		KerbinFlyingLowNorthernIceShelf = The icy cold of the surface is only getting colder as you go up.
		KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = The icy cold of the surface is only getting colder as you go up.
		
		KerbinFlyingHighWater = The conditions from just above the water are barely affecting the plants at this altitude.
		KerbinFlyingHighShore = The UV radiation seems to be stimulating the plant growth.
		KerbinFlyingHighBadlands = The plants grab your guitar and play a speed metal solo.
		KerbinFlyingHighDeserts = A sandstorm from far below sweeps microscopic dust particles into the hydroponics chamber.
		KerbinFlyingHighGrasslands = This high above the surface, the grasslands only vaguely resemble the plants' native terrain.
		KerbinFlyingHighMountains = The rarefied air causes some of the plants to struggle to grow.
		KerbinFlyingHighHighlands = As you carelessly open the observation window for a better look, one of the plants falls out of the aircraft.
		KerbinFlyingHighTundra = The plants aren't enjoying the air here.
		KerbinFlyingHighSouthernIceShelf = Yep, the plants are definitely frozen solid.
		KerbinFlyingHighNorthernIceShelf = Most of the plants appear to be frozen. The plants right next to the heaters are still (barely) hanging on.
		KerbinFlyingHighIceCaps = The ice down below appears to have an effect on the plants.
		
		KerbinInSpaceLow = The microgravity is affecting the plant growth in fascinating ways.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = You get transfixed by the zero-g growth of the plants. You're plant-related daydreaming is interrupted by mission control asking for a status update.
		
		MunInSpaceHigh = The plants are growing exactly the same as they did above Kerbin.
		MunInSpaceLow = The bumpy gravity field appears to be stimulating unusual growth in the plants.
		
		MunSrfLandedPoles = The plants see some water ice nearby, and begin to reach out for it.
		MunSrfLandedPolarLowlands = The unusual terrain seems to be intimidating the plants. They aren't quite sure what to do.
		MunSrfLandedPolarCrater = The plants are growing slightly slower here due to the shadows of the surrounding terrain.
		MunSrfLandedHighlands = The plants look disappointed that this is entirely unlike Kerbin's highlands.
		MunSrfLandedHighlandCraters = You hope that whatever caused these craters doesn't come a second time.
		MunSrfLandedMidlands = Wait! There are plants here! This is proof that this landing is on a soundstage!
		MunSrfLandedMidlandCraters = The plants shake with the vibrations of a distant meteor impact.
		MunSrfLandedLowlands = Despite the reduced gravity here, the plants are growing quite well.
		MunSrfLandedNortheastBasin = The surface here has a lot of useful nutrients. This causes the plants to grow much quicker.
